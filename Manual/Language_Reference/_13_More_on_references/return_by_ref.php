/*
Note: If you try to return a reference from a function with the syntax: return ($this->value);
this will not work as you are attempting to return the result of an expression, and not a variable,
by reference. You can only return variables by reference from a function - nothing else.
Since PHP 4.4.0 in the PHP 4 branch, and PHP 5.1.0 in the PHP 5 branch,
an E_NOTICE error is issued if the code tries to return a dynamic expression or a result of the new operator.
here you have to use & in both places -
to indicate that you want to return by reference, not a copy,
and to indicate that reference binding, rather than usual assignment, should be done for $myValue.

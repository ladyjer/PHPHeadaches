 * More precisely, late static bindings work by storing the class named in the last "non-forwarding call".
 * In case of static method calls, this is the class explicitly named (usually the one on the left of
 * the :: operator); in case of non static method calls, it is the class of the object. A "forwarding call" is
 * a static one that is introduced by self::, parent::, static::, or, if going up in the class hierarchy,
 * forward_static_call(). The function get_called_class() can be used to retrieve a string with
 * the name of the called class and static:: introduces its scope.

This feature was named "late static bindings" with an internal perspective in mind. "Late binding"
 * comes from the fact that static:: will not be resolved using the class where the method is defined but
 * it will rather be computed using runtime information. It was also called a "static binding" as it can
 * be used for (but is not limited to) static method calls.
